# flexbox-landing-page
This is the project that i did for the project odin curriculum.

I would like to thank "Arun Kumar", "Josh Hild", "Mohd Nazri Sulaiman", "Macro Photography" and "Huy Nguyen thanh" for all the images that i've used in this project. The links for each images are "https://www.pexels.com/pt-br/foto/praia-litoral-sombrio-escuro-9807390/", "https://www.pexels.com/pt-br/foto/foto-de-pessoa-andando-de-caiaque-2422463/", "https://www.pexels.com/pt-br/foto/barco-bote-canoa-alvorecer-9868835/", "https://www.pexels.com/pt-br/foto/barco-bote-alvorecer-amanhecer-7716157/" and "https://www.pexels.com/pt-br/foto/barco-bote-canoa-alvorecer-4070560/", respectively.

This project was awesome to built, i did most of the css style using flexbox knowledge, margin, padding, border, background properties and a lot more technics. I've also used html tags for the structure of the page and practice a lot of using the git for my commits.
